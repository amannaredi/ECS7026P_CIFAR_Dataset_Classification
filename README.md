# CIFAR-10 Image Classification

This project implements a neural network to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using PyTorch. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify these images into their respective categories.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `ECS7026P_CIFAR.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the full implementation and execution of the model.
